# Songbook Manager

***current version: 1.1.0***

It is a server side application (REST API) that lets the users manage songs in a songbook, manage accounts, playlists, own small songbooks and singing events.

### The idea

The idea for this application came to me when I joined the [**Sekcja Turystyki Kwalifikowanej**](http://stk.ue.poznan.pl/) (a group of tourists, especially mountains' enthusiasts, at my university in Pozna≈Ñ, Poland) and saw the PDF file where all the songs were stored. It was huge, around 900 pages. It was inconvenient to use. I decided to create a web application where it will be easier to update and explore the songbook and everyone can have their own library of songs, playlists and share it. 

***So it is a real-life problem solution.***

### Web clients

There will be two web clients of this application in the near future. One created with **Angular** by me. And one created by my friend (a Frontend dev) with **React**.


### Mobile client

After this application I will create an Android app that will be connected to this server and allow to explore it from Android devices and provide more features like `group singing` where everyone connects to one person and they can display the same page on all phones.
